Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Simon and this is my personal repo.

I'm currently in the process of learning Python3 and just trying to fill my Github with different projects right now. I still have a lot to learn, but it's been a very fun journey so far. 

In my respository, I'm including some SQL since I picked that up earlier and have refined it while studying python. I've done practice problems with sample databases like AdventureWorks and I will also have a separate section on interview questions involving SQL (I'm aggregating the questions from many different sites). I have also included some professional projects at this point (with permission from the employers).e

Lastly, if you look in my projects, you'll also find a link to my public Tableau profile. I've used Tableau for some data visualization for some content that I'm interested in. Right now it only has a few vizzes but I should populate it more as I get more time.

Hopefully this repo will offer some insight into my skills and my growth over time.
