Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Silijet, but some people call me Simon.

I'm currently in the process of learning Python3 and just trying to fill my Github with different projects right now. I still have a lot to learn, but it's been a very fun journey so far. Eventually I want to be able to apply what I've learned, to some real world applications.

In my respository, I'm also including some SQL since I picked that up earlier and have refined it while studying python. I've done practice problems with sample databases like AdventureWorks and I will also have a separate section on interview questions involving SQL (I'm aggregating the questions from many different sites). 

Lastly, if you look in my projects, you'll also find a link to my public Tableau profile. I've used Tableau for some data visualization for some content that I'm interested in. Right now it only has a few vizzes but I should populate it more as I get more time.

Hopefully with these skills, I want to start applying and working in data analytics!
