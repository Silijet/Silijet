Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Simon and this is my personal repo.

I am currently using this to include what I have learned in my experience from programming in Python and SQL. 

In my respository, I'm also including what I've done for practice problems with sample databases like AdventureWorks and sql-practice.com and I will also have a separate section on interview questions involving SQL (aggregating questions from many different sites). I have also included some professional projects at this point (with permission from the employers).

Lastly, if you look in my projects, you'll also find a link to my public Tableau profile. I've used Tableau for some data visualization for some content that I'm interested in. Right now it only has a few vizzes but I should populate it more as I get more time.

Hopefully this repo will offer some insight into my skills and my growth over time.
